                    <p>Travel Keys both welcomes and respects the contributions of travel agents in the Caribbean
                        villa rental process. Travel Keys pays commission to travel agents, and as such, luxury
                        villa rentals afford you the opportunity to impress your clients by presenting them with
                        exciting new ways to travel. With over 15 years of Caribbean villa rental experience,
                        Travel Keys features more than 28 destinations throughout the Caribbean and Mexico,
                        displays online availability, showcases exclusive virtual tours, and presents more
                        relevant vacation rental information than any other villa vacation rental website on
                        the internet.
                        As such, we can ensure that your clients are not only satisfied, but that the process
                        is both simple and enjoyable for everyone involved.</p>
